# Vite Vanilla JS Template

Initially built for personal use, I created this template for starting a new project with Vite.js and Vanilla Javascript. It is already set up with standard development tools like ESLint and Prettier for easy code formatting and linting, with Vite for a robust, modern build process.

## Scripts

Use the following scripts for your development workflow:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Checks your code for any linting errors
npm run lint

# Tries to automatically fix any linting errors present in your code
npm run lint:fix

# Formats your code in a consistent, predefined style using Prettier
npm run format

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the build
npm run preview

# Build and preview the project
npm run buildpreview
```

## Folder Structure

This is the structure of the project:

```plaintext
